# Database
Created an Oracle database based on the given schema and develop the application programs using Java to fulfill the following specific requirements:
a. Customers can search for records by name of the musician, title of the album, and name of the song.
b. Notown staff can search any table and can add/delete/alter a row in any table. Each Notown staff member has to provide this security code before she/he can submit an update command. No security check is needed for pure search.
c. Notown requires a user-friendly GUI. Items (a) and (b) shall be nicely integrated into this GUI environment.
d. For test purpose, please populate each table with at least five simulated (look-like-real) records/rows.
1. Each musician that records at Notown has an SSN, a name, an address, and a phone number. Poorly paid musicians often share the same address, and no address has more than one phone.
2. Each instrument used in songs recorded at Notown has a unique identification number, a name (e.g., guitar, synthesizer, and flute) and a musical key (e.g., C, B-flat, E-flat).
3. Each album recorded on the Notown label has a unique identification number, a title, a copyright date, a speed.
4. Each song recorded at Notown has a title and an author.
5. Each musician may play several instruments, and a given instrument may be played by several musicians.
6. Each album has a number of songs on it, but no song may appear on more than one album.
7. Each song is performed by one or more musicians, and a musician may perform a number of songs.
8. Each album has exactly one musician who acts as its producer. A musician may produce several albums, of course.
